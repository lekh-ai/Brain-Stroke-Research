## 📝 Introduction
A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. This project uses data mining techniques to predict strokes and identify significant attributes affecting stroke risk.

## 📊 Attributes and Data
The dataset includes various attributes that might influence stroke risk, such as:
- 🚭 Smoking
- 💉 High Blood Pressure
- 🩸 High Cholesterol
- ❤️ Heart Disease
- ⚡ Previous Stroke

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling null values
   - Correlation matrix analysis
   - Data augmentation using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

2. **Classification Algorithms**
   - 🌲 Random Forest Classifier
   - 📊 Naïve-Bayes Classifier
   - 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier
   - 🤝 KNN Classifier
   - 🔢 Logistic Regression
   - 📈 Support Vector Classifier
   - 🚀 AdaBoost Regression
   - ⚡ XGBoost Classifier

## 📈 Results
The performance of each classifier is measured based on accuracy:
- 🌲 **Random Forest Classifier**: 77.70%
- 📊 **Naïve-Bayes Classifier**: 70.32%
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**: 68.67%
- 🤝 **KNN Classifier**: 67.81%
- 🔢 **Logistic Regression**: 77.25%
- 📈 **Support Vector Classifier**: 78.24%
- 🚀 **AdaBoost Regression**: 88.91%
- ⚡ **XGBoost Classifier**: 79.60%

According to our research, the **AdaBoost Regression** model gives the highest accuracy for predicting if a person has a stroke or not.

## 📌 Conclusion
The study concludes that the AdaBoost Regression model is the most accurate for stroke prediction. However, it emphasizes the importance of regular health check-ups and self-inspection over relying solely on machine predictions.
